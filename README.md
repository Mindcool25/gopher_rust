# Rust Gopher server
A very simple implementation of a gopher server written in pure rust, using only the standard library. 

## Usage
`cargo run` will run the server, however you will probably need to run it as a superuser due to it being hosted on port 70.
All resources are in the resources directory, with the file called gophermap being the root file. Deeper directories are supported.

Images are still not finished
